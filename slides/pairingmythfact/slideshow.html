# Rules 

- Split into Teams up to 5 People
- Read the statement and decide if it is a myth or a fact
- One Team argues if the presented statement  is a Myth or a Fact
   - If the Answer is right: One point is awarded
- The next team can present another (different) answer
   - If the Answer is right: 2 points are awarded
- The start position switches to the next Team
- The Team with the most points wins
